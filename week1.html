    I stepped onto the carpeted battleground, heart racing like I’d just locked eyes with my sworn enemy—the dark, brooding tag that haunted my code and my dreams 🐺🖤 Each step was a challenge, a seduction, a whispered threat from the HTML hierarchy I swore I’d never bow to 😤🔥 But as my foot hovered over something shifted—was it hate?
